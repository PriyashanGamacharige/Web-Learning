              ThThe Diploma in Information Technology is designed by the Department of Information Technology of Faculty of Social Sciences in pursuit of enhancing the                rate of employability of the Arts graduates in Sri Lanka with regard to the emerging deficiency of the professional placements due to the majority of                 Arts graduates being delivered from the state universities. As the key areas of the industry are automated with the advancement of Information                          Technology, if a graduate possesses well trained IT skills blended with a sound knowledge, it influences the production of tech savvy graduates while                    fitting dynamic labor markets.</p>
